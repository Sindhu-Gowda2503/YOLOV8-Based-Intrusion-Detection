# YOLOV8-Based-Intrusion-Detection
This project leverages YOLOv8 for real-time object detection to build an intelligent intrusion detection and alert system. Designed to enhance surveillance in sensitive areas such as schools, offices, and public spaces, the system processes live video feeds or recorded footage to detect predefined objects (e.g., weapons or unauthorized entries).
